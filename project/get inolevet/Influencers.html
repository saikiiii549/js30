    <h1><b>Executive leaders forge diversity, equity, inclusion</b></h1>
    <p>Executive leaders have a responsibility to seek diversity, value equity, and embrace inclusion - whether</p>
    <p>in the workplace, community, government or industry. The thoughts, actions, and support of executive</p>
    <p>leaders is paramount to women's advancement.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here we shine a light on executive champions worldwide committed to forging an inclusive world.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned for IWD 2023 #EmbraceEquity Statements coming soon. Or submit an approved IWD</p>
    <p>Statement from your organization.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, reflect on some of last year's IWD 2022 Statements here.</p>
