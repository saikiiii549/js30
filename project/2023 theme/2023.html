    <h1><b>International Women's Day 2023 campaign </b></h1>
    <h1><b>theme: #EmbraceEquity</b></h1>
    <p>For International Women's Day and beyond, let's all fully</p><p><b>#EmbraceEquity.</b></p>
    <p>A focus on gender equity needs to be part of every society's DNA.</p>
    <p>Equity isn't just a nice-to-have, it's a must-have.</p>
    <p>And it's critical to understand the difference between</p> <p><b><i>equity</i></b></p> <p>and</p><p><b><i>equality.</i></b></p>
    <h1>Give equity a huge embrace</h1>
    <img src="../imager/2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>We can all truly</p><p><b>embrace equity.</b></p>
    <p>It's not just something we say. It's not just something we write about.</p>
    <p>It's something we need to think about, know, and embrace.</p>
    <p>It's what we believe in, unconditionally. Equity means creating an inclusive world.</p>
    <img src="../imager/3.jpg" alt="">
    <h1><b>And we can all play a part</b></h1>
    <p>Each one of us can actively support and</p><p><b>embrace equity</b></p><p>within our own sphere of influence.</p>
    <img src="../imager/4.jpg" alt="">
    <p>We can all challenge gender stereotypes, call out discrimination, draw attention to bias, and seek out inclusion. </p>
    <p>Collective activism is what drives change. From grassroots action to wide-scale momentum, we can all</p><p><b>embrace equity. </b></p>
    <p>Forging gender equity isn't limited to women solely fighting the good fight. Allies are incredibly important for </p>
    <p>the social, economic, cultural, and political advancement of women.</p>
    <img src="../imager/5.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Everyone everywhere can play a part.</p>
    <p>Collectively, we can all forge positive change.</p>
    <p>2023 International Women's Day campaign #EmbraceEquity</p>
    <h1><b>Being included, and belonging, feels good</b></h1>
    <p>When we embrace equity, we embrace diversity, and we embrace inclusion.</p>
    <p>We embrace equity to forge harmony and unity, and to help drive success for all.</p>
    <p>Equality is the goal, and equity is the means to get there. Through the process of equity, we can reach equality.</p>
